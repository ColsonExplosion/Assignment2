    <p>I hope to learn more about MVC and building dynamic webpages. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of ASP.NET and feel confident using it. I want to feel confident building dynamic web pages to display what I want them to display. I also am really excited to get into angular and react and other things I haven't used before!!</p>
    <br />
    <p>Here is a list of the top 3 jobs I hope to get after graduating: </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li> 1. Web Developer</li>
        <li> 2. Software Engineer</li>
        <li> 3. Start My Own Business</li>
    </ul>
